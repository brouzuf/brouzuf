- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @brouzuf

Driver of shunting and local lines at the SNCF on the Nice site since July 2006, I had the idea in December 2019, during the reorganization of the TGV fleet management service and with the announcement of the need to change the missions of the drivers, to develop a computer tool to facilitate the feedback of field information.
The need being present, the tool has evolved a lot and today, it manages the reuse of TGV trains in pre-operational and operational mode, the creation of layouts (car numbers) and the feedback from the drivers on the state of the trains, all in real time.

After the appropriate training, the tool has been in operational use since mid-May 2020 by about forty agents from different departments at the Nice site.

I enjoyed developing my tool independently and self-taught because, starting from scratch, I was able to identify the irritants of the agents and meet their needs. 
While facilitating their daily life and increasing productivity, their recognition is a great satisfaction. 

Since March 2021, the tool provides internal statistics to animate a visual management and a digitalized abandoned object procedure, thanks to an extension available on the smartphones of the operators of Nice station.

More recently, at the request of the Marseille management department, I developed a digital report book. It allows the transmission of instructions between the managers, to notify by email of any events that would appear during their day of service and allows the supervision of the tasks that are incumbent on them.

Because of the different requests I have received, I think there is an important need to support the digitalization of the business.
